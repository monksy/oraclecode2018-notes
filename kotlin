Kotlin 

  - Late presentation
  - Smart casting, and when== switch statement
  - 

  fun generateRandomNumber: Int { return 4 } 
  Named function parameters
  Default parameter values
  Has higher order functions

  Has monkey patching Int.isEven = 

  Has companon objects 
  Supports tell recursion

  Has compomanion objects

  Very groovy and scala like

  it in closure

  Refified generics

   \/ C++ inline \/ while I'm there also put this in there too
  inline fun <refified T> loggerOf():Logger = Logger.getLogger(T::class.java)
  
 Questions

 for mocks?
